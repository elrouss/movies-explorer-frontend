// PATTERNS
// These patterns are used for HTML5 built-in validation, which seems to have its own syntax specification.
// It doesn't accept slashes and should look like a string.
// E.x., to put a dot you should use character sets and ranges (\. - this won't work,
// and this - [.] or \\. - will be okay).
// It looks like that HTML5 validation doesn't have a high-security: user can delete pattern in DOM with DevTools,
// but for this project it will be okay
